WikiBlog is an open source modification of Nick Johnson's Bloggart application for Google App Engine. It aims to provide a combination of blog and wiki features, allowing any user to write a blog post, and to edit (unlocked) posts by other users.

Bloggart is a blog application for Google App Engine. It's currently being developed as a demonstration app for <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine">a series of blog posts</a>, but is intended to be a useful and versatile blogging system for App Engine by the time it's done.
